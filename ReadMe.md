# Earthquake Tracker

Using data from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov), this code powers [EarthquakeTracker.net](http://www.earthquaketracker.net/).

## Background

[William Bauer](http://williambauer.com/) of [Utopian Slingshot](http://utopianslingshot.com/) developed the previous iteration of this application.
